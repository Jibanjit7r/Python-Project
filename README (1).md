# Python Employee Salary Analyzer

This Python project demonstrates basic data handling, functions, loops, condition checking, and simple analysis. The program stores employee details in a list of dictionaries and performs three main tasks:

1. Displaying all employees
2. Finding the employee with the highest salary
3. Calculating department-wise total salary

This showcases Python fundamentals such as data structures, lambda functions, iteration, and clean program design.
